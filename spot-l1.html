  <h1>📈 Spot Trading Level One: Trading Fundamentals</h1>

  <h2>What Is Trading</h2>
  <p>Trading means buying and selling an asset to profit from price changes. In crypto this means you do not hold the coin forever. You aim to buy at a low price and sell at a higher price. For MedorCoin traders watch the price movements on an exchange and enter trades when they expect the price to rise or fall.</p>

  <h2>📊 Five Essential Trading Terms</h2>

  <h3>Market Order</h3>
  <p>A market order is an instruction to buy or sell immediately at the best current price. It prioritizes execution over price control so you enter or exit trades fast.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> You think MedorCoin will rise quickly so you place a market buy to get in right away.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Bid and Ask</h3>
  <p>Bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an asset.<br>
     Ask is the lowest price a seller accepts.<br>
     The spread is the difference between them. A smaller spread usually means cheaper and faster trades.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Bull Market and Bear Market</h3>
  <p>Bullish means prices are generally rising.<br>
     Bearish means prices are generally falling.</p>
  <p>Knowing this helps you choose a strategy. Buy in a bull market and consider selling or being cautious in a bear market.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Stop Loss Order</h3>
  <p>A stop loss automatically closes your trade if the price moves against you to a set level. It is essential for limiting losses.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you buy MedorCoin at $1 and set a stop loss at $0.90, your trade will close automatically if the price falls to $0.90.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Leverage</h3>
  <p>Leverage means using borrowed money to control a larger position than your own capital allows. It can make profits bigger but also increases losses.</p>
  <p>Beginners should be cautious because high leverage can lead to quick losses.</p>
